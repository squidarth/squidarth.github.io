I’ve been playing guitar on-and-off for the last few years, but this year decided to take things more seriously. I’ve been taking in-person lessons, but also have been watching a lot of Youtube content.

This has been a pretty good opportunity to reflect on how I learn effectively. The best approaches for
learning for me are approaches where you can do __something simple, completely_, and then gradually learn how to do more complex things. This is as opposed to an approach where one learns a lot of "fundamentals", and after that is able to produce a complete output (play a song, make a working piece of software, paint a painting). 

I've been calling this the MVP (minimal viable product) approach because of an analogy to the concept of [MVPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
in product development, where one starts with a small, simple product (the MVP), releases it, and then uses
feedback to improve upon it, as opposed to taking longer to release a more fully-fledged product.

This video “5 Levels of 'Hey Joe' by Jimi Hendrix" by Ayla Tesler-Mabe I think does this really well:

In this video, in the easy version, all you need are really basic chords, which are the absolute first thing that a guitar player would learn, to play the entire song. So, very quickly, one can already play the whole song (albeit, gratefully simplified). Subsequent levels introduce difficulty, and different techniques that get closer to what Jimi Hendrix was actually playing.

You could imagine an alternative approach, where you sequentially learn the different chords, scales, and techniques that are used on the actual record, and then at the end, put it together to play the actual song.

For me though, the approach that Ayla uses here is way more effective, and for a couple main reasons:

* It’s way easier to be engaged in a skill if you can actually do what you sought out to do earlier, rather than learning boring scales and chords that don’t feel musical
* If you stop halfway through, you’ll actually be able to do useful things still, so it won’t be a “waste” (I find that this makes the motivation required for starting way lower).

This reasoning is really similar to the value of using the MVP approach in product development, where the
goal is to get to value _faster_, rather than achieve perfection. This image from [Henrik Kniberg](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp) really sums it up well:

The best example I’ve seen of this in the tech world is the fast.ai course. In this course, rather than starting you off learning the principles of linear algebra, they start you on day 1 being able to build something useful using Machine Learning, and then after that, start breaking out the details.

I'd be curious to hear about other courses that take on approaches like this!
