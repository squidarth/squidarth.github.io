I picked up the [Google Site Reliability Engineering book](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/) a little
while ago at the suggestion of a couple of my coworkers. Having spent my entire
career so far at startups, it was fascinating to read about how Google manages
their production systems, both from a technical and non-technical perspective.

Even though this book was written by Google engineers, I think there are lessons
here that are applicable to engineers working on any production system.
Even if you aren't at Google-scale, or have the resources to put in place
the kinds of sytems they have put in place, it's definitely worth understanding
the *principles* they apply, and I highly recommend reading this book.

# What is Site Reliability Engineering?

Site Reliability Engineering is a role/function that Google developed that involves
applying software engineering practices to the problem of "operations" in running
a production system.
