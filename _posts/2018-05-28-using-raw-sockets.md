In an effort to learn how TCP/IP works, I decided to start playing around with
a low-level TCP/IP library, [smoltcp](https://github.com/m-labs/smoltcp). Some of
the examples (particularly, the clone of `tcpdump`) require using raw sockets,
which need to be run as the root user. Running network programs as root is pretty
dangerous, and is something that one should probably never do.

In this post, I'll be discussing how to use raw sockets without having to run the
whole program as root. And while the library I'm working with is written in Rust,
I'll be using examples written in C.

# Why does it mean to access a raw socket?

Sockets are the means by which programs on Linux way talk to the internet.
The [`socket` system call](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html)
creates a file descriptor that can be written to and read from. The [`connect` system call](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html)
can then be used to connect the socket to some remote address.
After that, writing to the
socket sends data to that remote address, while reading from the socket file
descriptor reads data sent from the remote address.

There are two main types of sockets, stream sockets, and datagram sockets.
I won't get into the details of these now, but streaming sockets are used for applications
that use TCP, while datagram sockets are for applications that use UDP. These are both
transport-level protocols that follow the network-level IP protocol.

If you are interested in writing your own implementations of one of these protocols,
or need to use a different transport-layer protocol, you'll need to use _raw_ sockets.
Raw sockets operate at the network OSI level, which means that transport-level headers
such as TCP or UDP headers will not be automatically decoded. If you are implementing a
a transport-level protocol, you'll have to write code to decode and encode the transport-level
headers in your application.

# Raw Sockets and Security

An important thing worth noting about this is that there is important security-related
information stored in TCP and UDP headers:

![TCP Packet Diagram]({{ "/assets/TCP_Protocol_Diagram.png"  }})

For instance, the destination port is stored in the TCP headers. This means that packets
read from raw sockets don't have any notion of "port".

To step back a little bit, an application using TCP or UDP must, when opening up a STREAM or DGRAM socket, declare a port to receive data on.  When the application reads data from that
socket, they will only see data that was sent to that particular port.

Now, with raw sockets, because network-level IP packets do not have a notion of "port", all
packets coming in over the server's network device can be read. Applications that open raw sockets
have to do the work of filtering out packets that are not relevant themselves, by parsing the TCP
headers. The security implications of this are pretty serious--it means that applications with
a raw socket open can read any inbound network packets, including those headed to other applications
running on the system, which may or may not be run as the same unix user as the application with
the raw socket open.

To prevent this from happening, Linux requires that any program that accesses raw sockets be
run as root. Actually running network programs as root is dangerous, especially for a sufficiently
complicated program, like a TCP implementation.

In this post I'll cover a couple different strategies for circumventing this.


# Attempting to read from a raw socket

To see what happens when we read data from sockets, let's use this C program that
simply sniffs packets entering the system and prints out some information about
the packet as an example:

{% highlight c %}
// raw_sock.c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<netinet/ip.h>
#include<sys/socket.h>
#include<arpa/inet.h>

int main() {
    // Structs that contain source IP addresses
    struct sockaddr_in source_socket_address, dest_socket_address;

    int packet_size;

    // Allocate string buffer to hold incoming packet data
    unsigned char *buffer = (unsigned char *)malloc(65536);
    // Open the raw socket
    int sock = socket (PF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_TCP);
    if(sock == -1)
    {
        //socket creation failed, may be because of non-root privileges
        perror("Failed to create socket");
        exit(1);
    }
    while(1) {
      // recvfrom is used to read data from a socket
      packet_size = recvfrom(sock , buffer , 65536 , 0 , NULL, NULL);
      if (packet_size == -1) {
        printf("Failed to get packets\n");
        return 1;
      }

      struct iphdr *ip_packet = (struct iphdr *)buffer;

      memset(&source_socket_address, 0, sizeof(source_socket_address));
      source_socket_address.sin_addr.s_addr = ip_packet->saddr;
      memset(&dest_socket_address, 0, sizeof(dest_socket_address));
      dest_socket_address.sin_addr.s_addr = ip_packet->daddr;

      printf("Incoming Packet: \n");
      printf("Packet Size (bytes): %d\n",ntohs(ip_packet->tot_len));
      printf("Source Address: %s\n", (char *)inet_ntoa(source_socket_address.sin_addr));
      printf("Destination Address: %s\n", (char *)inet_ntoa(dest_socket_address.sin_addr));
      printf("Identification: %d\n\n", ntohs(ip_packet->id));
    }

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Compiling this program with:
```bash
$ gcc raw_sock.c
```

And then running it with:
```bash
$ ./a.out
```

yields the following error:

```
Failed to create socket: Operation not permitted
```

# Options

The most basic thing that you can do to run the program
is to run the program as root:

```bash
$ sudo ./a.out
New Packet:
Packet Size (bytes): 40
Source Address: 10.0.2.2
Destination Address: 10.0.2.15
Identification 2541

New Packet:
...
```

This is very clearly not ideal. With root access, programs can
do some serious damage to the system, and with a sufficiently
complicated network program, the chances of something going wrong
and pretty high.

## The solution: Linux Capabilities

Thankfully, programs don't have to be run with full root access in order
to be able to use raw sockets. Linux has a feature called [_capabilities_](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html).
Linux capabilities allow _some_ features previously limited to processes running as root (with `sudo`)
to be used by processes that are unprivileged. The very handy `CAP_NET_RAW` capability can be used
to open raw sockets.

Capabilities are applied on a per-file basis with the `setcap` command. This example applies the
`CAP_NET_RAW` and `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capabilities to the `a.out` binary. Once these capabilities
have been set on the file, non-root users will be able to run these programs.

```bash
$ sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw=eip a.out
```

You can verify that the capabilities were added by running:

```bash
$ sudo getcap a.out
a.out = cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+eip
```

Setting capabilities on executables allows you to run these programs
without having to run the risk of these being run as root.

See these two great blog posts for more details on Linux capabilities in this context.

# Future Investigation

Being able to provide programs with access to raw sockets without providing full root access
is key to being able to run programs like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) safely on our computers.

Hope you found this interesting/helpful! Next up I'll be covering the Linux `socket` API
in more detail.
